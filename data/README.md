# BART hourly origin-destination data

The Shiny app expects a file named `date-hour-soo-dest-all.csv` to be in this folder.
The intention is to use the [preparser](../preparser/README.md) to create this file.

## Data format

This file should be the same format as [the BART hourly origin-destination data](https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership).
The CSV should look like this, with no header:

```
2011-05-23,4,FRMT,UCTY,77
```

While there isn't a header, each column should be the following:

1. Date, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
2. Hour, in 24-hour time.
3. Source station, in BART's 4-letter abbreviation code.
4. Destination station, in BART's 4-letter abbreviation code.
5. The number of passengers who traveled between those two adjacent stations.

It expects there to only be values between adjacent stations.
Additionally, there should only be one entry for each combination of date, hour, source, and destination.

## Provided file

The version currently in the folder was generated by the preparser on 2019-03-14.
It contains the results of the preparser for the origin-destination data from 2011 to 2018.

If you would like to update this data, run the preparser with new files.
See the [preparser](../preparser/README.md) for more information.
